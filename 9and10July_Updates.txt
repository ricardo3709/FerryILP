I tried multithreading, but it was a bit cumbersome and I didn't quite understand it, so I used a pre-saved pkl file to speed up the process.
Because separating the files requires modifying the parameters in each equation, which requires a lot of related details to be modified, it is currently decided to run it in one file.
The model can bre run now but it is infeasible
constraint 6s causing issue for the model now, mainly associated withe the Dc, Tc, nc values.
