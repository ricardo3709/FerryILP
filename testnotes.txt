1, cycle lines:
all lines information is updated, correspodning code is updated

2, F10 headway:
F10 is with a cycle time of 40, only one vessle can serve the line, but the headway is 30


3, tested models:

output_cycles1:
Full task arrangement of 6h --> infeasible, calculating IIS now (29Aug 10:14)

output_cycles2_1: --> infeasible
A few task arrangement of 2h-3h/6h
output_cycles2_1: --> infeasible

1 Sep
output_cycles3_1: fixed line infos (use full cycle times) + sailing time code + many vessel (40min headway for F10)
7756273.pbsserver --> Last satge Unfinished, 100 hrs time is not enough

output_cycles3_2: fixed line infos (use full cycle times) + sailing time code + real vessel fleet size (40min headway for F10)
7756274.pbsserver --> Infeasible

output_cycles3_3: fixed line infos (use partial cycle times) + new vessel fleet + (30min headway for F10)
7762471 --> 7 Sep(3:06pm)


14 Sep
output_cycles4: Partial solution test
7770082.pbsserver --> 14 Sep(2:41pm)


version 4 and 4.1 results:
4: fix values
4.1: set as starting values


version 4.2 results: optimised gap 0.1


version 4.3 with charging constraints gap 0.3..?


version 4.4 with charging constrains + crew pause: gap 0.5..?

version 4.5 with charging constrains + crew pause: gap 0.5


Next steps: 
1. weighted solution + charging at CQ is a decision (and thus charging is a constraint). 
2. Present results in neater ways.
