1, cycle lines:
all lines information is updated, correspodning code is updated

2, F10 headway:
F10 is with a cycle time of 40, only one vessle can serve the line, but the headway is 30


3, tested models:

output_cycles1:
Full task arrangement of 6h --> infeasible, calculating IIS now (29Aug 10:14)

output_cycles2_1: --> infeasible
A few task arrangement of 2h-3h/6h
output_cycles2_1: --> infeasible

1 Sep
output_cycles3_1: fixed line infos (use full cycle times) + sailing time code + many vessel (40min headway for F10)
7756273.pbsserver --> Last satge Unfinished, 100 hrs time is not enough

output_cycles3_2: fixed line infos (use full cycle times) + sailing time code + real vessel fleet size (40min headway for F10)
7756274.pbsserver --> Infeasible

output_cycles3_3: fixed line infos (use partial cycle times) + new vessel fleet + (30min headway for F10)
7762471 --> 7 Sep(3:06pm)


14 Sep
output_cycles4: Partial solution test
7770082.pbsserver --> 14 Sep(2:41pm)


version 4 and 4.1 results:
4: fix values (Rob's solution)
# Objective Vessel utilization Value: 19.0
# Objective Total rebalancing time Value: 233.0

4.1: set as starting values

version 4.2 results: optimised gap 0.1 (Obtained)

version 4.3 with charging constraints gap 0.3 (Obtained)

version 4.4 with charging constrains + crew pause: gap 0.2 (Obtained)

version 4.5: Test for revising problem with the blank in visulisation

# ----------------------------- 11 OCT Updates -----------------------------

Version 5.0:（2587s around 45mins）
    - new cycles data (without considering peak/off peak differences since the 6 hours is not too long)
    - 30 min crew pause
    - 50% rebalancing focus + 50% fleetsize focus
    - gap 0.5 test workability


Vesion 5.1: (set this as the initial solution from now and then, directly run about 86s)
    - Fixed cycles data (with considering peak/off lines)
    - 30 min crew pause
    - 50% rebalancing focus + 50% fleetsize focus
    - gap 0.99 test workability

    ## Objects records:
    Vessel utilization Value: 19.0
    Total rebalancing time Value: 168.0

Version 5.2: 
    - Fixed cycles data
    - 30 min crew pause
    - 90% rebalancing focus + 10% fleetsize focus
    - gap 0.2




Next steps: 
    4. Longer hours 
    7. fix visulisation rebalancing box
    1. reweighted objectives (almost)
    2. more resonable crew pause (?)

    3. check rebalancing error (Done)
    5. fix peak and off peak issue (Done)
    6. fix initial solution input (Done)
