This txt file outlines the development progress of the program through multiple versions detailing key changes and improvements at each stage. 
The complete version log, including detailed modifications and results, is available in the archive folder 'version_log_copy.txt'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verison1,2,3:
    - Initial testing, no feasible results

Version4:
    - Originally based Rob's mannully solution

Version5:
    - New cycles data with considering peak/off lines
    - 30 min crew pause
    - weighted rebalancing + fleetsize objective
    
version6:
    - with operational margin (run about 5882.30 s)
    - new varibale and constraints (jump penalty)
    - cycle discharging rate is fixed to be average ones

Version 7:
    - test of 6 + 6 berths --> infeasible.
    - keep with 5 wharf configuration but with more clear names.
    - Updated more strict jump penalty 

    updated (4 MAY) jumps have been reduced to 0.

Current Solution in Folder (version8.0) (Could be used as the starting version for later tests)
- Vessel Utilization Value: 19.0
- Rebalancing Time Value: 240.0
- Total penalise of tasks: 0.0


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next steps:
1.  Optimise Number of Jumps (Done)
    current result:
    - Vessel Utilization Value: 19.0
    - Rebalancing Time Value: 240.0
    - Total penalise of tasks: 0.0

2. Apply Constraint & Re-Optimise
    - Set a constraint: Number of jumps â‰¤ 0.
    - Return to the previous approach: Minimise the weighted objectives, alpha * fleet + (1-alpha) *rebalancing.
    - Assess if the jump limit allow enough flexibility and explore potential improvements.

test requried:
    - Charging rate
    - Charging time at the outer terminal
    - Other parameters (if possible)
    - Alpha


.....

? Meeting with TfNSW Details:
    - no charging at outer terminal
    - Charging only available at CQ and Barangaroo
    - Larger fleet size 26Vessels
    - Bar 4,5 only for waiting/ crew break?
