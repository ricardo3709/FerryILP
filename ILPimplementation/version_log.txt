This txt file outlines the development progress of the program through multiple versions detailing key changes and improvements at each stage. 
The complete version log, including detailed modifications and results, is available in the archive folder 'version_log_copy.txt'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verison1,2,3:
    - Initial testing, no feasible results

Version4:
    - Originally based Rob's mannully solution

Version5:
    - New cycles data with considering peak/off lines
    - 30 min crew pause
    - weighted rebalancing + fleetsize objective
    
version6:
    - with operational margin (run about 5882.30 s)
    - new varibale and constraints (jump penalty)
    - cycle discharging rate is fixed to be average ones

Version 7:
    - test of 6 + 6 berths --> infeasible.
    - keep with 5 wharf configuration but with more clear names.
    - Updated more strict jump penalty 


Current Solution in Folder (version7.0) (Could be used as the starting version for later tests)
    Vessel Utilization Value: 19.0
    Rebalancing Time Value: 242.0
    Total panalise of tasks: 13.0

Next steps:
1.  Optimise Number of Jumps
    - Focus on minimising the number of jumps in the objective function.
    - Include fleet size with a small epsilon multiplier to avoid unnecessary extra ferries.
    - Confirm if the minimum number of jumps is 22 (verify from the table).

2. Apply Constraint & Re-Optimise
    - Set a constraint: Number of jumps â‰¤ ??(TBD).
    - Return to the previous approach: Minimise the weighted objectives, alpha * fleet + (1-alpha) *rebalancing.
    - Assess if the jump limit allow enough flexibility and explore potential improvements.
