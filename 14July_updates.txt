Model Debugging Overview 11-14July

Initially, the model repeatedly ran into feasibility issues. 
Initial investigations pinpointed "crew pause" tasks as potential culprits. 
However, removing these tasks only uncovered further complexities, which were too computationally intensive to resolve through the Irreducible Inconsistent Subsystem (IIS) analysis.

Restarted with the first a few constraints of the model and adjusted key input parameters, such as the starting site Sv.
the model could have multiple solutions based solely on constraints from 1a to 1k.

and then gradually integrating more constraints:
- + Constraint 4: Integrating constraint 4 with the base model (1a-1k) led to infeasibility. By relaxing the values of variable x, which adjusts the first sailing time, feasible solutions were obtained.
- + Constraints 6a and 6b: Similarly, adding constraints 6a and 6b made the model infeasible, but it was solvable upon relaxing variable x.
- + Combining Constraints 4, 6a, and 6b: This combination once again resulted in infeasibility, but feasible solutions emerged after adjusting variable x. But the solution make no sailing at all --> not reasonable
- For constraints 2, 3, and 5a to 5c: These constraints significantly increased computational load and did not yield solutions even with a relaxed variable x.

the ILPimplementation/Output_files currently stores the results for model with constraints from 1a to 1k and 4 only and with relaxation for the x variable (Line 19 can have its first sailing at the expected times).
