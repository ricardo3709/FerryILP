1. ILPimplementation/ResultsProcess.py
The ResultsProcess.py file is complete and successfully processes the ILP model variable results.
The code might be lengthy and unoptimized, and it needs to be integrated into main.py for better organization.

2. Constraint 3
Constraint 3 ensures that vessels do not overlap in their tasks, which likely introduces significant combinatorial complexity
The model is solvable with all constraints excepts which about crew pause and charging, but due to the optimization conditions, it requires an enormous amount of computation time (24h-run has been tested but get no optimised solution).
Currently, introducing auxiliary variables or aggregating constraints to reduce the combinatorial explosion.
The original code for Constraint 3 in ILPimplementation/constraints.py causes extensive computation time. We are trying to solve this by introducing auxiliary variables.
The original code is commented out but preserved for review.
