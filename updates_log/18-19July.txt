1. Simplification Issue in F3 Sailing Routes:
Assuming the F3 sailing sequence as "cq <--> brg <--> prmt" is an unrealistic simplification. 
This assumption will likely lead to increased congestion at the docks for cq and brg, impacting the availability for other tasks at these docks. 
This does not reflect the real-world scenario.

2. Wharf Occupancy and Dwell Time:
line_info.csv file has been modified, and associated functions are modified.
The dwell time should be calculated based on the smaller minimum dwell time. 
And the buffer time = O + B + OM

3. Rebalancing Time:
The rebalancing time table is now updated for all sations but with blank cell for unknow infomation.
Since there is no information for Blackwattle Bay;but it's required for F10 or issue occurs.
The current infomation in the OD matrix about Blackwattle Bay, all the calculations are manually done so it's just an approxiamation.

4. Constraints and Practical Implications:
There are issues related to constraints 2 and 3 when dealing with two consecutive tasks at the same station. 
For instance, in the case of F10's round trips, if the interval between the two tasks is lengthy, such as 2 time periods, constraint 2 forces the vessel to a wharf that can accommodate waiting/charging tasks. 
However, the wharves specified in Bset and B+ set are far from F10â€™s Blackwattle Bay, making it difficult to satisfy constraint 3. This is a specific example I've identified, and it is unclear whether there are similar issues elsewhere in the model.
